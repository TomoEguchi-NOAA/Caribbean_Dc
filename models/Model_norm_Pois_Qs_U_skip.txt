# For this model, the raw counts were used as data (y). The state model
# is normal and the observation model is Poisson. I added skip nesting
# in this model by having a proportion of Nt available for sampling.
#
# I didn't see any reason to make the priors flatter because that would make convergence difficult
# and did not gain anything in return. 
#
# In this approach, I use one U (population grwoth rate).

# This model was converted from one for the Indonesia leatherback nesting project.

# Changed the data format to make LOOIC computations easier. All data are now in
# vectors. 2026-01-09

# Old data format:
# Provide the following variables in data 
# n.beaches = the number of beaches (a scalar)
# n.years = the number of years of observations per beach (a vector)
# years = observation years in 1 or 2, where 1 is before the change year and 2 is for since the change year (a matrix of n.beaches x max(n.years)). This needs to match with y below.
# y = observed number of nests/females per year (a matrix of n.beaches x max(n.years))
# high.low = high/low years in 1 or 2. It is a matrix of n.beaches x max(n.years), where 1 and 2 alternate from the first year to the end. This parameter is trying to incorporate high/low cyclical nature of observed nesting.
